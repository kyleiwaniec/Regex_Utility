Java class assignment:

Regular Expression Matcher

Design a utility class (Regex) in Java which will implement POSIX Extended Regular Expressions.  Additionally, you will need to write the supporting data structure classes, and a JFrame-based demonstration utility to show off your design, that minimally allows the user to enter regular expressions and the strings to be tested and shows meaningful results.
